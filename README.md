# MSc Computer Science Project

## Investigating pedagogical approaches for spatial and logical reasoning tasks in virtual reality environments

The project will examine the application of pedagogical approaches in virtual reality (VR). It will appraise the medium as a pedagogical tool by developing a VR application for experimental investigation. The findings will inform educators and the wider field about the ways in which VR can be effectively used in educational contexts.
